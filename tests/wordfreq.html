美利堅合眾國憲法

當根據聯邦條例組成的第一個國家政府證明不能將原來的十三州結合成一個統一的國家時，美國人民探用了現在的合眾國憲法。合眾國憲法是世界上最古老的國家憲法之一，一七八九年三月四日正式成為美國的基本大法。數年之後，增加了首十條憲法修正案，亦即所謂權利法案，在其後的一個半世紀中又增加了另外十多條修正案。

序 言

我們，美利堅合眾國的人民，為了組織一個更完善的聯邦，樹立正義，保障國內的安寧，建立共同的國防，增進全民福利和確保我們自己及我們後代能安享自由帶來的幸福，乃為美利堅合眾國制定和確立這一部憲法。

　

第一條

第一款：本憲法所規定的立法權，全屬合眾國的國會，國會由一個參議院和一個眾議院組成。


第二款：眾議院應由各州人民每兩年選舉一次之議員組成， 各州選舉人應具有該州州議會中人數最多之一院的選舉人所需之資格。

凡年齡未滿二十五歲，或取得合眾國公民資格未滿七年，或於某州當選而並非該州居民者，均不得任眾議員。

眾議員人數及直接稅稅額，應按聯邦所轄各州的人口數目比例分配，此項人口數目的計算法，應在全體自由人民－－包括訂有契約的短期僕役，但不包括未被課稅的印第安人－－數目之外，再加上所有其他人口之五分之三。實際人口調查，應於合眾國國會第一次會議三年內舉行，並於其後每十年舉行一次，其調查方法另以法律規定之。眾議員的數目，不得超過每三萬人口有眾議員一人，但每州至少應有眾議員一人；在舉行人口調查以前，各州得按照下列數目選舉眾議員：新罕布什爾三人、麻薩諸塞八人、羅德島及普羅維登斯墾殖區一人、康涅狄格五人、紐約州六人、新澤西四人、賓夕法尼亞八人、特拉華一人、馬裡蘭六人、弗吉尼亞十人、北卡羅來納五人、南卡羅來納五人、喬治亞三人。

任何一州的眾議員有缺額時，該州的行政長官應頒選舉令，選出眾議員以補充缺額。

眾議院應選舉該院議長及其他官員；只有眾議院具有提出彈劾案的權力。


第三款： 合眾國的參議院由每州的州議會選舉兩名參議員組成之，參議員的任期為六年，每名參議員有一票表決權。

參議員第一次選舉後舉行會議之時，應當立即盡量均等地分成三組。第一組參議員的任期，到第二年年終時屆滿，第二組到第四年年終時屆滿，第三組到第六年年終時屆滿，俾使每兩年有三分之一的參議員改選；如果在某州州議會休會期間，有參議員因辭職或其它原因出缺，該州的行政長官得任命臨時參議員，等到州議會下次集合時，再予選舉補缺。

凡年齡未滿三十歲，或取得合眾國公民資格未滿九年，或於某州當選而並非該州居民者，均不得任參議員。
合眾國副總統應為參議院議長，除非在投票票數相等時，議長無投票權。

參議院應選舉該院的其他官員，在副總統缺席或執行合眾國總統職務時，還應選舉臨時議長。

所有彈劾案，只有參議院有權審理。在開庭審理彈劾案時，參議員們均應宣誓或誓願。如受審者為合眾國總統，則應由最高法院首席大法官擔任主席；在未得出席的參議員的三分之二的同意時，任何人不得被判有罪。

彈劾案的判決，不得超過免職及取消其擔任合眾國政府任何有榮譽、有責任或有俸給的職位之資格；但被判處者仍須服從另據法律所作之控訴、審訊、判決及懲罰。


第四款： 各州州議會應規定本州參議員及眾議員之選舉時間、地點及程序；但國會得隨時以法律制定或變更此種規定，惟有選舉議員的地點不在此例。

國會應至少每年集合一次，開會日期應為十二月的第一個星期一，除非他們通過法律來指定另一個日期。


第五款： 參眾兩院應各自審查本院的選舉、選舉結果報告和本院議員的資格，每院議員過半數即構成可以議事的法定人數；不足法定人數時，可以一天推一天地延期開會，並有權依照各該議院所規定的程序和罰則，強迫缺席的議員出席。

參眾兩院得各自規定本院的議事規則，處罰本院擾亂秩序的議員，並且得以三分之二的同意，開除本院的議員。

參眾兩院應各自保存一份議事記錄，並經常公佈，惟各該院認為應保守秘密之部分除外；兩院議員對於每一問題之贊成或反對，如有五分之一出席議員請求，則應記載於議事記錄內。

在國會開會期間，任一議院未得別院同意，不得休會三日以上，亦不得遷往非兩院開會的其他地點。


第六款： 參議員與眾議員得因其服務而獲報酬，報酬的多寡由法律定之，並由合眾國國庫支付。兩院議員除犯叛國罪、重罪以及擾亂治安罪外，在出席各該院會議及往返各該院途中，有不受逮捕之特權；兩院議員在議院內所發表之演說及辯論，在其它場合不受質詢。

參議或眾議員不得在當選任期內擔任合眾國政府任何新添設的職位，或在其任期內支取因新職位而增添的俸給；在合眾國政府供職的人，不得在其任職期間擔任國會議員。


第七款 ：有關徵稅的所有法案應在眾議院中提出；但參議院得以處理其它法案的方式，以修正案提出建議或表示同意。

經眾議院和參議院通過的法案，在正式成為法律之前，須呈送合眾國總統；總統如批准，便須簽署，如不批准，即應連同他的異議把它退還給原來提出該案的議院，該議院應將異議詳細記入議事記錄，然後進行復議。倘若在復議之後，該議院議員的三分之二仍然同意通過該法案，該院即應將該法案連同異議書送交另一院，由其同樣予以復議，若此另一院亦以三分之二的多數通過，該法案即成為法律。但遇有這樣的情形時，兩院的表決均應以贊同或反對來定，而贊同和反對該法案的議員的姓名，均應由兩院分別記載於各該院的議事記錄之內。如總統接到法案後十日之內(星期日除外) ，不將之退還，該法案即等於曾由總統簽署一樣，成為法律，惟有當國會因而無法將該法案退還時，該法案才不得成為法律。

任何命令、決議或表決(有關休會問題者除外) ，凡須由參議院及眾議院予以同意者，均應呈送合眾國總統；經其批准之後，方始生效，如總統不予批准，則參眾兩院可依照對於通過法案所規定的各種組別和限制，各以三分之二的多數，再行通過。


第八款： 國會有權規定並徵收稅金、捐稅、關稅和其它賦稅，用以償付國債並為合眾國的共同防禦和全民福利提供經費； 但是各種捐稅、關稅和其它賦稅，在合眾國內應劃一徵收；
以合眾國的信用舉債；
管理與外國的、州與州間的，以及對印第安部落的貿易；
制定在合眾內一致適用的歸化條例，和有關破產的一致適用的法律；
鑄造貨幣，調節其價值，並釐定外幣價值，以及制定度量衡的標準；
制定對偽造合眾國證券和貨幣的懲罰條例；
設立郵政局及建造驛路；
為促進科學和實用技藝的進步，對作家和發明家的著作和發明，在一定期限內給予專利權的保障；
設置最高法院以下的各級法院；
界定並懲罰海盜罪、在公海所犯的重罪和違背國際公法的罪行；
宣戰，對民用船隻頒發捕押敵船及採取報復行動的特許證，制定在陸地和海面虜獲戰利品的規則；
募集和維持陸軍，但每次撥充該項費用的款項，其有效期不得超過兩年；
配備和保持海軍；
制定有關管理和控制陸海軍隊的各種條例；
制定召集民兵的條例，以便執行聯邦法律，鎮壓叛亂和擊退侵略；
規定民兵的組織、裝備和訓練，以及民兵為合眾國服務時的管理辨法，但各州保留其軍官任命權，和依照國會規定的條例訓練其民團的權力；
對於由某州讓與而由國會承受，用以充當合眾國政府所在地的地區(不逾十哩見方)，握有對其一切事務的全部立法權；對 於經州議會同意，向州政府購得，用以建築要塞、彈藥庫、兵工 廠、船塢和其它必要建築物的地方，也握有同樣的權力；－－並且
為了行使上述各項權力，以及行使本憲法賦予合眾國政府或其各部門或其官員的種種權力，制定一切必要的和適當的法律。


第九款 ：對於現有任何一州所認為的應准其移民或入境的人，在一八○八年以前，國會不得加以禁止，但可以對入境者課稅，惟以每人不超過十美元為限。

不得中止人身保護令所保障的特權，惟在叛亂或受到侵犯的情況下，出於公共安全的必要時不在此限。

不得通過任何褫奪公權的法案或者追溯既往的法律。

除非按本憲法所規定的人口調查或統計之比例，不得徵收任何人口稅或其它直接稅。

對各州輸出之貨物，不得課稅。

任何有關商務或納稅的條例，均不得賦予某一州的港口以優惠待遇；亦不得強迫任何開往或來自某一州的船隻，駛入或駛出 另一州，或向另一州納稅。

除了依照法律的規定撥款之外，不得自國庫中提出任何款項；一切公款收支的報告和帳目，應經常公佈。

合眾國不得頒發任何貴族爵位：凡是在合眾國政府擔任有俸給或有責任之職務者，未經國會許可，不得接受任何國王、王子 或外國的任何禮物、薪酬、職務或爵位。


第十款： 各州不得締結任何條約、結盟或組織邦聯；不得對民用船隻頒發捕押敵船及採取報復行動之特許證；不得鑄造貨幣；不得發行紙幣；不得指定金銀幣以外的物品作為償還債務的法定貨幣；不得通過任何褫奪公權的法案、追溯既往的法律和損害契約義務的法律；也不得頒發任何貴族爵位。

未經國會同意，各州不得對進口貨物或出口貨物徵收任何稅款，但為了執行該州的檢查法律而有絕對的必要時，不在此限；任何州對於進出口貨物所徵的稅，其淨收益應歸合眾國國庫使用；所有這一類的檢查法律，國會對之有修正和監督之權。

未經國會同意，各州不得徵收船舶噸位稅，不得在和平時期保持軍隊和軍艦，不得和另外一州或外國締結任何協定或契約，除非實際遭受入侵，或者遇到刻不容緩的危急情形時，不得從事戰爭。


第二條


第一款： 行政權力賦予美利堅合眾國總統。總統任期四年，總統和具有同樣任期的副總統，應照下列手續選舉：

每州應依照該州州議會所規定之手續，指定選舉人若干名，其人數應與該州在國會之及眾議員之總數相等；但參議員、眾議員及任何在合眾國政府擔任有責任及有俸給之職務的人，均不得被指定為選舉人。

各選舉人應於其本身所屬的州內集會，每人投票選舉二人，其中至少應有一人不屬本州居民。選舉人應開列全體被選人名單，註明每人所得票數；他們還應簽名作證明，並將封印後的名單送至合眾國政府所在地交與參議院議長。參議院議長應於參眾兩院全體議員之前，開拆所有來件，然後計算票數。得票最多者，如其所得票數超過全體選舉人的半數，即當選為總統；如同時不止一人得票過半數，且又得同等票數，則眾議院應立即投票表決，選舉其中一人為總統；如無人得票過半數，則眾議院應自得票最多之前五名中用同樣方法選舉總統。但依此法選舉總統時，應以州為單位，每州之代表共有一票；如全國三分之二的州各有一名或多名眾議員出席，即構成選舉總統的法定人數；當選總統者需獲全部州的過半數票。在每次這樣的選舉中，於總統選出後，其獲得選舉人所投票數最多者，即為副總統。但如有二人或二人以上得票相等時，則應由參議院投票表決，選舉其中一人為副總統。

國會得決定各州選出選舉人的時期以及他們投票的日子；投票日期全國一律。

只有出生時為合眾國公民，或在本憲法實施時已為合眾國公民者，可被選為總統；凡年齡未滿三十五歲，或居住合眾國境內未滿十四年者，不得被選為總統。

如遇總統被免職，或因死亡、辭職或喪失能力而不能執行其權力及職務時，總統職權應由副總統執行之。國會得以法律規定，在總統及副總統均被免職，或死亡、辭職或喪失能力時，由何人代理總統職務，該人應即遵此視事，至總統能力恢復，或新總統被選出時為止。

總統得因其服務而在規定的時間內接受俸給，在其任期之內，俸金數額不得增加或減低，他亦不得在此任期內，自合眾國政府和任何州政府接受其它報酬。

在他就職之前，他應宣誓或誓願如下：「我鄭重宣誓（或矢言)我必忠誠地執行合眾國總統的職務，並盡我最大的能力，維持、保護和捍衛合眾國憲法。」


第二款： 總統為合眾國陸海軍的總司令，並在各州民團奉召為合眾國執行任務時擔任統帥；他可以要求每個行政部門的主管官員提出有關他們職務的任何事件的書面意見，除了彈劾案之外，他有權對於違犯合眾國法律者頒發緩刑和特赦。

總統有權締訂條約，但須爭取參議院的意見和同意，並須出席的參議員中三分之二的人讚成；他有權提名，並於取得參議院的意見和同意後，任命大使、公使及領事、最高法院的法官，以及一切其他在本憲法中未經明定、但以後將依法律的規定而設置之合眾國官員；國會可以制定法律，酌情把這些較低級官員的任命權，授予總統本人，授予法院，或授予各行政部門的首長。

在參議院休會期間，如遇有職位出缺，總統有權任命官員補充缺額，任期於參議院下屆會議結束時終結。


第三款： 總統應經常向國會報告聯邦的情況，並向國會提出他認為必要和適當的措施，供其考慮；在特殊情況下，他得召集兩院或其中一院開會，並得於兩院對於休會時間意見不一致時，命令兩院休會到他認為適當的時期為止；他應接見大使和公使；他應注意使法律切實執行，並任命所有合眾國的軍官。


第四款： 合眾國總統、副總統及其他所有文官，因叛國、賄賂或其它重罪和輕罪，被彈劾而判罪者，均應免職。


第三條


第一款： 合眾國的司法權屬於一個最高法院以及由國會隨時下令設立的低級法院。最高法院和低級法院的法官，如果盡忠職守，應繼續任職，並按期接受俸給作為其服務之報酬，在其繼續任職期間，該項俸給不得削減。


第二款：司法權適用的範圍，應包括在本憲法、合眾國法律、和合眾國已訂的及將訂的條約之下發生的一切涉及普通法及衡平法的案件；一切有關大使、公使及領事的案件；一切有關海上裁判權及海事裁判權的案件；合眾國為當事一方的訴訟；州與州之間的訴訟，州與另一州的公民之間的訴訟，一州公民與另一州公
民之間的訴訟，同州公民之間為不同之州所讓與之土地而爭執的訴訟，以及一州或其公民與外國政府、公民或其國民之間的訴訟。

在一切有關大使、公使、領事以及州為當事一方的案件中，最高法院有最初審理權。在上述所有其它案件中，最高法院有關於法律和事實的受理上訴權，但由國會規定為例外及另有處理條例者，不在此限。

對一切罪行的審判，除了彈劾案以外，均應由陪審團裁定，並且該審判應在罪案發生的州內舉行；但如罪案發生地點並不在任何一州之內，該項審判應在國會按法律指定之地點或幾個地點舉行。


第三款：只有對合眾國發動戰爭，或投向它的敵人，予敵人以協助及方便者，方構成叛國罪。無論何人，如非經由兩個證人證明他的公然的叛國行為，或經由本人在公開法庭認罪者，均不得被判叛國罪。

國會有權宣佈對於叛國罪的懲處，但因叛國罪而被褫奪公權者，其後人之繼承權不受影響，叛國者之財產亦只能在其本人生存期間被沒收。


第四條


第一款： 各州對其它各州的公共法案、記錄、和司法程序，應給予完全的信賴和尊重。國會得制定一般法律，用以規定這種法案、記錄、和司法程序如何證明以及具有何等效力。

第二款： 每州公民應享受各州公民所有之一切特權及豁免。

凡在任何一州被控犯有叛國罪、重罪或其它罪行者，逃出法外而在另一州被緝獲時，該州應即依照該罪犯所逃出之州的行政當局之請求，將該罪犯交出，以便移交至小該犯罪案件有管轄權之州。

凡根據一州之法律應在該州服役或服勞役者，逃往另一州時，不得因另一州之任何法律或條例，解除其服役或勞役，而應依照有權要求該項服役或勞役之當事一方的要求，把人交出。

第三款： 國會得准許新州加入聯邦；如無有關各州之州議會及國會之同意，不得於任何州之管轄區域內建立新州；亦不得合併兩州或數州、或數州之一部分而成立新州。

國會有權處置合眾國之屬地及其它產業，並制定有關這些屬地及產業的一切必要的法規和章則；本憲法中任何條文，不得作有損於合眾國或任何一州之權利的解釋。


第四款 ：合眾國保證聯邦中的每一州皆為共和政體，保障它們不受外來的侵略；並且根據擄各州州議會或行政部門(當州議會不能召集時)的請求，平定其內部的暴亂。



第五條


舉凡兩院議員各以三分之二的多數認為必要時，國會應提出對本憲法的修正案； 或者， 當現有諸州三分之二的州議會提出請求時，國會應召集修憲大會，以上兩種修正案，如經諸州四分之三的州議會或四分之三的州修憲大會批准時，即成為本憲法之一部分而發生全部效力，至於採用那一種批准方式，則由國會議決；但一八○八年以前可能制定之修正案，在任何情形下，不得影響本憲法第一條第九款之第一、第四兩項；任何一州，沒有它的同意，不得被剝奪它在參議院中的平等投票權。


第六條


合眾國政府於本憲法被批准之前所積欠之債務及所簽訂之條約，於本憲法通過後，具有和在邦聯政府時同等的效力。

本憲法及依本憲法所制定之合眾國法律；以及合眾國已經締結及將要締結的一切條約，皆為全國之最高法律；每個州的法官都應受其約束，任何一州憲法或法律中的任何內容與之牴觸時，均不得有違這一規定。

前述之參議員及眾議員，各州州議會議員，合眾國政府及各州政府之一切行政及司法官員，均應宣誓或誓願擁護本憲法；但合眾國政府之任何職位或公職，皆不得以任何宗教標準作為任職的必要條件。


第七條


本憲法經過九個州的制憲大會批准後，即在批准本憲法的各州之間開始生效。

We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.


Article.I.
Section.1.

All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.
Section.2.

The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.

No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.

Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pensylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.

When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.

The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.
Section.3.

The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.

Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.

No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.

The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.

The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.

The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.
Section.4.

The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Place of chusing Senators.

The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.
Section.5.

Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.

Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.

Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.

Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.
Section.6.

The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.

No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.
Section.7.

All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.

Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.

Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.
Section.8.

The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;
